# 🌟 Modern Todo App Features

This document describes the enhanced features added to the Ionic React Todo App.

## 📋 Feature Overview

### 1. Priority Levels 🎯

Each todo can be assigned one of three priority levels:

- **High** 🔴 - Urgent tasks that need immediate attention
- **Medium** 🟡 - Important tasks with moderate urgency (default)
- **Low** 🟢 - Tasks that can be done when time permits

**Visual Indicators:**
- High priority: Red badge
- Medium priority: Yellow/Orange badge
- Low priority: Green badge

**How to Use:**
1. When creating a new todo, select priority from the dropdown
2. Priority defaults to "Medium" if not specified
3. Edit existing todos to change their priority level
4. Priority badges are displayed prominently on each todo item

---

### 2. Categories 📁

Organize your todos into meaningful categories for better task management.

**Default Category:** General

**Suggested Categories:**
- Work
- Personal
- Shopping
- Health
- Finance
- Education
- Home
- Travel

**How to Use:**
1. Enter a category name when creating or editing a todo
2. Categories are displayed as blue chips on todo items
3. Use consistent naming for better organization
4. Categories are case-sensitive

---

### 3. Due Dates 📅

Set due dates for your todos and get visual reminders about upcoming deadlines.

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Overdue** 🔴 - Red chip showing "Xd overdue"
- **Due Today** 🟡 - Orange chip showing "Due today"
- **Due Tomorrow** 🔵 - Blue chip showing "Due tomorrow"
- **Future** ⚪ - Gray chip showing "Due in Xd"

**How to Use:**
1. Set a due date using the date picker when creating/editing todos
2. Due dates are optional - leave blank for todos without deadlines
3. Overdue todos are highlighted in red automatically
4. Completed todos retain their due date information

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Color-Coded Visual System

The app uses a consistent color scheme to help you quickly identify task status:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🔴 Red | High priority / Overdue |
| 🟡 Yellow/Orange | Medium priority / Due today |
| 🟢 Green | Low priority |
| 🔵 Blue | Categories / Due soon |
| ⚪ Gray | Future due dates |

### Todo Item Display

Each todo item now displays:
1. **Checkbox** - Mark as complete/incomplete
2. **Title** - Bold, with strikethrough when completed
3. **Description** - Smaller text, with strikethrough when completed
4. **Metadata Bar** - Shows priority badge, category chip, and due date chip
5. **Edit Button** - Quick access to edit modal
6. **Swipe to Delete** - Swipe left to reveal delete option

## 📊 Data Structure

### Todo Object Fields

```typescript
interface Todo {
  id?: string;                              // Auto-generated by Firestore
  title: string;                            // Required: Task title
  description: string;                      // Task description
  completed: boolean;                       // Completion status
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';     // Priority level (default: 'medium')
  category: string;                         // Category name (default: 'General')
  dueDate?: Date;                           // Optional due date
  createdAt: Date;                          // Auto-generated timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;                          // Auto-updated timestamp
}
```

### Firebase Firestore Collection

**Collection Name:** `todos`

**Document Structure:**
```json
{
  "title": "Complete project documentation",
  "description": "Write comprehensive docs for the todo app",
  "completed": false,
  "priority": "high",
  "category": "Work",
  "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Categories are free-text - no predefined list

3. No filtering options on the main list
4. No confirmation dialog before deleting
5. No undo functionality for deletions

These limitations keep the app simple while demonstrating core CRUD operations and modern UI patterns.
