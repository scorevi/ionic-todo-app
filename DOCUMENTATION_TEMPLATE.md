## 4. Database Structure

### Collection: `todos`

Each document in the collection has the following structure:

```
Document ID: [Auto-generated by Firestore]
├── title: string (e.g., "Buy groceries")
├── description: string (e.g., "Milk, bread, eggs")
├── completed: boolean (true or false)
├── createdAt: timestamp (e.g., December 1, 2025 at 10:30:00 AM)
└── updatedAt: timestamp (e.g., December 1, 2025 at 2:45:00 PM)
```

### Data Flow
1. User creates todo → App sends data to Firestore
2. Firestore stores document with auto-generated ID
3. App reads from Firestore and displays in UI
4. User updates/deletes → App updates Firestore
5. Changes reflect immediately in the app

---

## 5. CRUD Implementation Details

### CREATE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `createTodo()`
- Takes title and description as parameters
- Adds new document to Firestore "todos" collection
- Sets completed to false by default
- Adds createdAt and updatedAt timestamps
- Returns the document ID

### READ
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `getAllTodos()` and `getCompletedTodos()`
- Queries Firestore collection
- Orders by createdAt (newest first)
- Filters by completed status for completed tab
- Maps Firestore documents to Todo objects
- Returns array of todos

### UPDATE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `updateTodo()` and `toggleTodoComplete()`
- Takes document ID and updated fields
- Updates specific document in Firestore
- Updates updatedAt timestamp
- Checkbox toggle updates only completed status
- Edit modal updates title and description

### DELETE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `deleteTodo()`
- Takes document ID as parameter
- Permanently removes document from Firestore
- Triggered by swipe-left gesture and trash button

---

## 6. Navigation Structure

### Tab-Based Navigation
The app uses Ionic's tab navigation with three main tabs:

1. **Todos Tab** (`/todos`)
   - Default landing page
   - Shows active (incomplete) todos
   - Floating action button to add new todos

2. **Completed Tab** (`/completed`)
   - Shows completed todos only
   - Same CRUD functionality as Todos tab

3. **About Tab** (`/about`)
   - App information and documentation
   - Features list
   - Technology stack
   - Database structure

### Component Structure
```
App.tsx (Root)
├── IonTabs
│   ├── TodoList Page (Tab 1)
│   │   ├── TodoItem components
│   │   ├── AddTodoModal
│   │   └── EditTodoModal
│   ├── Completed Page (Tab 2)
│   │   ├── TodoItem components
│   │   └── EditTodoModal
│   └── About Page (Tab 3)
└── IonTabBar (Bottom Navigation)
```
