## 1. App Overview

### Description
A hybrid mobile application built with Ionic React that demonstrates complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Firebase Firestore as the backend database.

### Purpose
This Todo List application allows users to manage their tasks effectively by creating, viewing, updating, and deleting todos. The app syncs data in real-time with Firebase Firestore.

### Key Features

- 🎯 Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) with color-coded badges
- 📁 Organize tasks by category (Work, Personal, Shopping, etc.)
- 📅 Set due dates and track overdue tasks with visual indicators
- 📖 View all active todos with rich metadata display
- ✏️ Edit existing todo details including priority and category
- ✔️ Mark todos as complete/incomplete with checkbox
- 🗑️ Delete todos with swipe gesture
- 📊 Separate view for completed tasks
- 🔄 Real-time Firebase Firestore synchronization
- 📱 Tab-based navigation (Todos, Completed, About)
- 🔃 Pull-to-refresh functionality
- 📐 Responsive design for all screen sizes
- 🎨 Modern UI with badges, chips, and color indicators

## 4. Database Structure

### Collection: `todos`

Each document in the collection has the following structure:

```
Document ID: [Auto-generated by Firestore]
├── title: string (e.g., "Buy groceries")
├── description: string (e.g., "Milk, bread, eggs")
├── completed: boolean (true or false)
├── priority: string ("low", "medium", or "high")
├── category: string (e.g., "Shopping", "Work", "Personal")
├── dueDate: timestamp (optional, e.g., December 15, 2025)
├── createdAt: timestamp (e.g., December 1, 2025 at 10:30:00 AM)
└── updatedAt: timestamp (e.g., December 1, 2025 at 2:45:00 PM)
```

### Example Document

```json
{
  "title": "Complete project documentation",
  "description": "Write comprehensive docs for the todo app",
  "completed": false,
  "priority": "high",
  "category": "Work",
  "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User creates todo → App sends data to Firestore
2. Firestore stores document with auto-generated ID
3. App reads from Firestore and displays in UI
4. User updates/deletes → App updates Firestore
5. Changes reflect immediately in the app

## 5. CRUD Implementation Details

### CREATE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `createTodo()`
- Takes title, description, priority, dueDate, and category as parameters
- Priority defaults to "medium", category defaults to "General"
- Adds new document to Firestore "todos" collection
- Sets completed to false by default
- Adds createdAt and updatedAt timestamps
- Returns the document ID

### READ
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `getAllTodos()` and `getCompletedTodos()`
- Queries Firestore collection
- Orders by createdAt (newest first)
- Filters by completed status for completed tab
- Maps Firestore documents to Todo objects with all fields (priority, category, dueDate)
- Provides default values for missing fields (priority: "medium", category: "General")
- Returns array of todos

### UPDATE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `updateTodo()` and `toggleTodoComplete()`
- Takes document ID and updated fields (title, description, priority, category, dueDate)
- Updates specific document in Firestore
- Updates updatedAt timestamp automatically
- Checkbox toggle updates only completed status
- Edit modal updates all fields including priority, category, and due date

### DELETE
**File:** `src/services/todoService.ts` - `deleteTodo()`
- Takes document ID as parameter
- Permanently removes document from Firestore
- Triggered by swipe-left gesture and trash button

---

## 6. Navigation Structure

### Tab-Based Navigation
The app uses Ionic's tab navigation with three main tabs:

1. **Todos Tab** (`/todos`)
   - Default landing page
   - Shows active (incomplete) todos
   - Floating action button to add new todos

2. **Completed Tab** (`/completed`)
   - Shows completed todos only
   - Same CRUD functionality as Todos tab

3. **About Tab** (`/about`)
   - App information and documentation
   - Features list
   - Technology stack
   - Database structure

### Component Structure
```
App.tsx (Root)
├── IonTabs
│   ├── TodoList Page (Tab 1)
│   │   ├── TodoItem components
│   │   ├── AddTodoModal
│   │   └── EditTodoModal
│   ├── Completed Page (Tab 2)
│   │   ├── TodoItem components
│   │   └── EditTodoModal
│   └── About Page (Tab 3)
└── IonTabBar (Bottom Navigation)
```
